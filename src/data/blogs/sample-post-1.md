# Building Modern Web Applications with Vue 3

Vue 3 has revolutionized how we build web applications, introducing powerful new features that make development more enjoyable and maintainable. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the Composition API and other exciting features.

## Why Vue 3 Matters

Vue 3 brings significant improvements over Vue 2:

- **Better Performance**: Up to 2x faster rendering and 41% smaller bundle size
- **Composition API**: More flexible component logic organization
- **Better TypeScript Support**: Built with TypeScript from the ground up
- **Multiple Root Elements**: No more single root element requirement

## Getting Started with Composition API

The Composition API allows you to organize component logic by feature rather than by option type. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    // Reactive data
    const count = ref(0)
    const name = ref('Vue 3')
    
    // Computed properties
    const doubleCount = computed(() => count.value * 2)
    
    // Methods
    const increment = () => {
      count.value++
    }
    
    // Lifecycle hooks
    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component mounted!')
    })
    
    return {
      count,
      name,
      doubleCount,
      increment
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Custom Composables

Create reusable logic with custom composables:

```javascript
// composables/useCounter.js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const count = ref(initialValue)
  
  const increment = () => count.value++
  const decrement = () => count.value--
  const reset = () => count.value = initialValue
  
  return {
    count,
    increment,
    decrement,
    reset
  }
}
```

### Using the Composable

```javascript
import { useCounter } from '@/composables/useCounter'

export default {
  setup() {
    const { count, increment, decrement, reset } = useCounter(10)
    
    return {
      count,
      increment,
      decrement,
      reset
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Composition API for complex components**
2. **Extract reusable logic into composables**
3. **Leverage TypeScript for better development experience**
4. **Keep components focused and single-purpose**

## Conclusion

Vue 3's Composition API provides a more flexible and powerful way to build web applications. By organizing logic by feature and creating reusable composables, you can build more maintainable and testable code.

Start experimenting with these patterns in your next project and experience the power of modern Vue development!
